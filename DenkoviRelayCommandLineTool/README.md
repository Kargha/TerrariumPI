# Denkovi V2 relay board support

As the license of Denkovi does not allow to ship their command line tool with my software. Therefore you have to download and install it manually.

## Installation
Download the Denkovi Command line tool from: http://denkovi.com/denkovi-relay-command-line-tool. Download it and unpack it into this directory.
Then either rename the jar file to DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool.jar or make a symlink to it.

The software expects the following file to exists: DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool/DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool.jar from the root TerrariumPI directory.

## Setup
In TerrariumPI use one of the hardware types that starts with DenkoviV2
